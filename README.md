Goals

Followings are the main goals to achieve in this project:

1. extract information from the dataset to figure out relationship between features and house sale price

2. reveal insight intuitively from EDA with data visualization and inferencial statistics

3. construct Feature Engineering for Machine Learning model building

4. build Machine Learning models to reasonably predict better house sale price
